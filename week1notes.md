`5.3 - Computing Bias`

### Questions
- **Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

  The owner likely does not think this was intentional.

- **If yes or no, justify you conclusion.**

  He most likely understands that this was a lapse in judgement during the development of this product.

- **How do you think this happened?**

  The product was not properly tested and was programmed without a proper sample.

- **Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

  Yes this is harmful, because it paints the company that made this error in a very bad light. It was almost cerntainly not intended to be harmful, as this company would have no motive.

- **Should it be corrected?**

  A mistake like this should definitely be correct ASAP, as a group of people are being excluded from this technology.

- **What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

  Ensure better testing phase policies so that mistakes like this can't be released to the public.

- Wikipedia is the largest source of crowdsourcing by letting users edit the pages.
- All crypto exchanges are validated by 3 different miners to make sure the exchange is not fraudulent.
- Using an API is an example of crowdsourcing.
- Forking github code is also an example of crowdsourcing.
