`5.3 - Computing Bias`

- **Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

  The owner likely does not think this was intentional.

- **If yes or no, justify you conclusion.**

  He most likely understands that this was a lapse in judgement during the development of this product.

- **How do you think this happened?**

  The product was not properly tested and was programmed without a proper sample.

- **Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

  Yes this is harmful, because it paints the company that made this error in a very bad light. It was almost cerntainly not intended to be harmful, as this company would have no motive.

- **Should it be corrected?**

  A mistake like this should definitely be correct ASAP, as a group of people are being excluded from this technology.

- **What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

  Ensure better testing phase policies so that mistakes like this can't be released to the public.

`5.4 - Crowdsourcing`

- **CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

  

- **What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

  

## Week 0 

`5.1 - Beneficial and Harmful Effects`
* Essential Knowledge
  * IOC-1.A.1.  
  People create computing innovations.

  * IOC 1.A.2.  
  The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.

  * IOC 1.A.3.   
  Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.

  * IOC 1.A.4.   
  A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or the same person.

  * IOC 1.A.5.   
  Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

  * IOC 1.B.1.  
  Computing innovations can be used in ways their creators had not initially intended:  
   

* Wii controller   
  * Benefit: Gets people to be more active while playing games.   
  * Harmful: Broken TVs and injuries.

* Multirotor  
  * Benefit: Deliveries, finding lost people aerial photography is easy.   
  * Harmful: Flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy concerns

* Call system with many branches of conditions and associated responses allows no room for system failure and ensures faster customer experience.
