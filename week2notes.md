`5.5 - Legal and Ethical Concerns`

### Questions

- **When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.**

There are varying licenses that restrict other people from using your code/material certain amounts. Some licenses such as the MIT license are very easy to work with and allows use of code for free. The creative commons license has copyright restrictions and is tougher to distribute.

- **Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.**

We picked the MIT license because we want our code to be easily accessable with little restriction.

  * IOC-1.F   
  Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.

    * Creative Commons: A public copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyright work. This is used when the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use and build upon the work they have created
  

`5.6 - Safe Computing`

### Questions

- **Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.**   
People have their names and emails on their sites.

- **What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?**   
I'm not too worried about PII as long as it's limited to my name and minimal contact through an alternate email account.

- **Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.**   
Good passwords are decently long, use a good mix of letters/numbers/symbols, and don't reference to anything about your life. Bad passwords are actual words or just too short. Another step that can be used is 2-step authentication. This requires a second confirmation from an email/text sent to you specifically.

- **Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.**   
Symmetric encryption uses 1 key that's distributed among many people to decrypt. Asymmetric encryption uses both public and a private key to decrypt/encrypt data.

- **Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.**  
User accounts with usernames and passwords.

- **Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.**  
I was once sent a link from a close friend that was a free premium account to a subscription I used often. Their reason for giving me the subscription seemed legitamate and the url asked me for card info (as most time-limited subscriptions want a payment method to renew once the term ends). After putting my card info in, the site was bugging out and I noticed that one letter in the url was slightly off from the proper url for the site. My friend later messaged me that their account had been breached and told me not to use the link they sent me. I managed to cancel that card before it had been used. The site was extremely well made and looked and worked identically to the actual site is was mimicking.
